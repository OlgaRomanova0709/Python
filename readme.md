#  PyBank
Perfomed anysis of financial records of a company PyBank using Python script. The provided dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

--The total number of months included in the dataset


--The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


--The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


--The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


--The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results at the same time.

#  PyPoll
I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates a set of metrics to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.


The following calcilations were performed:


--The total number of votes cast,


--A complete list of candidates who received votes,


--The percentage of votes each candidate won,


--The total number of votes each candidate won,


--The winner of the election based on popular vote.
