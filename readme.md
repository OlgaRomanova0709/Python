#  PyBank
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

We created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

--The total number of months included in the dataset


--The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


--The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


--The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


--The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Our final script print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results at the same time.

#  PyPoll
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)


We created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


--The total number of votes cast


--A complete list of candidates who received votes


--The percentage of votes each candidate won


--The total number of votes each candidate won


--The winner of the election based on popular vote.
